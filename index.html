            <p>WYDKYDK is a web application that aims to <strong>point out the things you don't know you don't know.</strong>
            It works by providing users with "stories" about topics they which to investigate their knowledge in. 
            These stories are written by experts in their fields, in such a way that they cover as much material from their respective field as possible.
            As they are reading them, users click on the concepts they have never heard of and
            at the end of each story, a summary with a percentage of how much knowledge of the field they are aware of and links for more information about each unfamiliar concept is generated for them.

            <p>Tommcomm is a mobile application supported by a powerful back-end server that aims to <strong>give users real time information about the world that surrounds them as they are commuting.</strong>
            It is the intersection of web APIs and geolocation, and delivers, among others, relevant data about public transformation status, weather forecast, historical facts about commuter's current location, nearby points of interest, and breaking news.
            Information is delivered by a state-of-the-art text-to-speech artificial voice (think J.A.R.V.I.S' from the Iron Man series, without the A.I. stuff, <strong>yet</strong>).
